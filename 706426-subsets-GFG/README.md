Given an array arr[] of distinct positive integers, your task is to find all its subsets.
Note: You can return the subsets in any order, the driver code will print them in sorted order.
Examples:
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3]
Output: [[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, 3], [2], [2, 3], [3]]
Explanation: The subsets of [1, 2, 3] in lexicographical order are:
[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, 3], [2], [2, 3], [3]
Input: arr[] = [2, 4]
Output: [[], [2], [2, 4], [4]]
Explanation:
The subsets of [2, 4] in lexicographical order are:
[], [2], [2, 4], [4]
Constraints :
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 103
